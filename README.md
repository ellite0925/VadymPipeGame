# pipe-dream
A web-version of Pipe Game.

## Rules
* To place a pipe, click an empty square. The pipe cannot be rotated, only placed.
* To replace a tile, just click the occupied square.
* The queue shows upcoming tiles.
* The water begins flowing after the timer counts down. Score points by connecting pipes to the start pipe.
* Water will flow straight until it hits a curve.
